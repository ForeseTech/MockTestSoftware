# FORESE MockTestSoftware
This is the git for the software used to conduct aptitude tests for the mock placements at SVCE college annually. The software consists of a front-end built on HTML, CSS and JS and a back-end built on PHP and MySQL.

Students can attempt the test from any browser as the test software is located on an online server (the link shall not be provided as this software is used internally for college purposes). Students log into the software using their name, registration and other details AND with a pre-determined 'Terminal Number' and password given to them by the invigilator. The test has a specific time limit and question range. Once finished with all the questions, students can submit their answers. A report will be generated and handed over to them later containing their scores.

The admin has to enter questions in the database (structure provided in SQL Schema folder) according to their 'Set Number'. Once students have submitted their answers, the responses are recorded in the database. Students can then go to the 'Report Portal' which is also online and generate reports.
