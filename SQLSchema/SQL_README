#Important Notes about the SQL Schema in this folder:-
	i) The schema titled 'MOCKS' is the schema with the complete structure and data of the original database.
	ii) The schemas titled 'SCORES1A', 'SCORES1B', etc, are schemas from every stage of the mock tests. 1A is 1st day - batch A and 1B is 1st day - batch B, etc etc.
	iii) These are very important. Cannot be deleted.
